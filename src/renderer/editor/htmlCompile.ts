 * and the same walk the offline compiler runs measures it here. That removes a
 * whole Electron process from the save-and-watch loop — the file is saved and
 * the slides move, with no spawn in between — and it means the geometry is
 * measured by the very engine that will draw it.
 *
 * The iframe is not a nicety: the authoring page carries the deck's `theme.css`
 * without the player's positioning rules, which would wreck the editor's own
 * layout if it were mounted in this document.
