# Collaborative editing

The remaining desktop-only capabilities are tracked in
[Desktop → web feature parity](desktop-web-parity.md).

A standalone server hosts a **directory of deck folders**; any number of
people edit them from their browsers — over tailscale or any trusted network.
Everyone sees everyone's cursors, selections, and which slide each person is
on. The server never reads or writes anything outside the directory it was
launched on: every immediate subdirectory containing a `deck.json` is an
openable deck, new decks and Keynote imports are created inside it, and over
HTTP only each deck's `assets/` subtree is servable.

## Hosting from the desktop app

The **Collaborate** toolbar button shares the deck currently open in the
desktop app. The main process starts the same collab server pinned to that
one deck (port 5800, or a free port if taken) and hands the editor window off
to the browser client over localhost. The old shell stays visible until the
new one is ready, and its bounds, maximized state, active slide, and selection
carry across. The host becomes an ordinary peer, so
there is never a second writer on `deck.json`. The status bar shows the
invite URL (the LAN/tailscale address); anyone opening it lands directly in
the shared presentation. In a hosted session the New / Open / Import
Keynote… controls are absent for everyone: the server refuses deck listing
beyond the shared deck, deck creation, and Keynote import. The host's window
has an **End collaboration** button (also: just closing the window) that
ends the session for everyone — joiners see "session ended by the host" and
stop reconnecting — then reloads the deck from disk and brings the ordinary
editor back through the same continuous handoff. The button only appears (and
`/api/end` only works) for the
loopback client in a hosted session, i.e. the host machine.

The loopback host also keeps the desktop's **Agent…** control during
collaboration. It explains how to point an existing filesystem agent at the
deck; it does not run an agent or own an account. Agent edits enter the shared
transaction stream, so human peers see them live, in History, and as Agent
presence.

Only one deck can be hosted at a time, across every window the app has open:
see **Known limits**.

Requires the built browser client (`npm run build:collab`); packaged builds
ship it in `dist/collab`.

## Agent sessions

The **Agent…** toolbar button is onboarding for an agent the user already runs.
On desktop it shows the open deck folder and the `slide-agent` starting
commands. In a browser collaboration session it shows a `slide-agent connect`
command that creates a local mirror of the live deck. DeckWerk has no embedded
chat, model picker, login, or server-owned agent account.

After that small difference in setup, both surfaces use the same loop:

1. `slide-agent context` reads the outline and current selection.
2. `slide-agent inspect --html …` or `slide-agent new` creates an authoring file
   under `edit/`.
3. Editing and saving that file synchronizes it into the presentation.

Every accepted save is still compiled into native objects and applied as one
named, revision-checked transaction. It remains visible to collaborators,
appears in History, and can be undone normally. In a browser collaboration
session, the panel's scratchpad shows the remote bridge's current activity and
source/imported previews; it is a view of the filesystem workflow, not a
second authoring interface. The local desktop path needs neither that bridge
nor a collaboration server: its existing editor watcher observes the real
deck folder directly.

## Comments

Slides and elements carry `comments: [{id, author, text, ts, resolved}]`
arrays in `deck.json`, so comments sync, merge, and export like any other
edit. In the UI: hover a slide row in the rail for the comment bubble
(bottom-right; it stays visible with the open count once comments exist);
on the canvas, elements with comments show a bubble at their top-right
corner, and right-click → "Add comment…" starts a thread on any object.
Comments from a collab session carry the author's display name.

## The edit log

The server appends one line per accepted change to `history.jsonl` in the
deck folder: when, who (display name, tailnet login with `--access`, client
id, whether an agent sent it), the label, counts per operation, and the full
JSON of every slide or object the change deleted, so nothing that vanishes
is unrecoverable. Replacements are logged by id only. It rotates to
`history.1.jsonl` at 20 MB, travels with the folder on rename and trash, and
is never mirrored, served or downloaded. `slide-agent history <deck folder>
--deleted` reads it; the format is described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Running a standalone server

Build the browser client once (rebuild after pulling client changes):

```bash
npm run build:collab
```

Start the server on a directory of decks:

```bash
npm run collab -- path/to/decks            # binds 0.0.0.0:5800
npm run collab -- path/to/decks --port 6000 --host 127.0.0.1
```

It prints every reachable URL (localhost plus each network interface — the
tailscale address is among them). Collaborators open the URL in a browser and
pick a presentation; `?name=Alice` sets the display name, otherwise the client
asks once and the server falls back to `Guest n`.

### Running under systemd

A standing server is best run as a hardened systemd service: its own user,
`ProtectHome`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`, a syscall filter.
One thing in that hardening has to give. The server lays out every page an
agent saves, renders every PNG `./deck render` asks for and runs every
`./deck web check` in headless Chromium, and Chromium refuses to run without
its own sandbox — which on Linux lives in user, pid and net namespaces and
needs chroot(2) and capset(2) to enter them. `RestrictNamespaces=yes` and a
filter that denies `@privileged` and `@mount` forbid all of that. Pages and
sockets still work, so such a server looks healthy until an agent's first
save.

[`packaging/linux/deckwerk-collab-chromium-sandbox.conf`](../packaging/linux/deckwerk-collab-chromium-sandbox.conf)
is the drop-in that allows exactly those and nothing more:

```bash
sudo install -D -m 0644 packaging/linux/deckwerk-collab-chromium-sandbox.conf \
  /etc/systemd/system/deckwerk-collab.service.d/chromium-sandbox.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart deckwerk-collab
```

(A root-owned setuid `chrome-sandbox` is no way round it: `NoNewPrivileges`
ignores setuid bits. Turning Chromium's sandbox off instead would leave
collaborators' pages rendering with nothing between them and the server's
decks.)

A server whose browser cannot start refuses to start, and says why in its
log. So does one that cannot import decks: before it listens, the server runs
each importer's `--self-check`, imports a small Keynote and PowerPoint deck
through its own upload code, and runs ffmpeg and ffprobe. The importers' Python
packages live in the checkout's own `.venv-import`, which `npm ci` creates from
`importers/requirements.txt` and `npm run collab` brings up to date before
every start (`npm run setup:importers` does it by hand). A deploy that cannot
import therefore fails its health check and rolls back (`deploy/update.sh`),
instead of failing somebody's upload with "keynote-parser is not installed". `test/agentCollaborationSandbox.test.ts`
runs the agent workflow under this policy, and — on a machine where
`deckwerk-collab.service` is installed — under the unit systemd actually
resolved.

### Folders

Decks can live in folders under the root, nested up to 8 levels deep. A folder
is an ordinary directory that holds decks (and other folders) instead of a
`deck.json` — make one in the picker or in Finder, either works — and a deck's
id is simply its path, so `clients/acme/pitch` is the deck `pitch` inside
`clients/acme`. Every deck-scoped route, the asset URLs and the WebSocket take
that path as the id.

- `GET /api/folders` lists the folders this person can see, each with its
  parent, its name and how many decks of theirs it holds.
- `POST /api/folders?path=clients/acme` creates one (parents included).
  `DELETE /api/folders?path=…` removes one, and only when it is empty:
  deleting presentations is never a side effect of a folder operation.
- `POST /api/decks?name=…&folder=…` and the two import routes create inside a
  folder; the picker and the toolbar pass the folder you are working in.
- `POST /api/decks/move?deck=<id>&folder=<path>` files an existing deck
  somewhere else. The id is the room key and the session directory, so a move
  is refused while anyone has the deck open.
- `POST /api/decks/rename?deck=<id>&name=<name>` renames a deck: the last
  segment of its id and the title the picker shows are the same name, so both
  change together. Like a move it waits for the room to be empty.
- `POST /api/folders/rename?path=<path>&name=<name>` renames a folder in
  place. Every deck inside is filed under that path, so all of their ids
  change at once and none of them may be open.

The picker browses the tree with a breadcrumb; New, Import and New folder all
act in the folder you are looking at. Each row a person manages carries
Rename…, and a deck row also Move… and Share….

### Access control (`--access`)

By default the server has no notion of users: every deck under the root is
open to anyone who can reach the port. For a standing multi-user deployment
(e.g. a lab server on a tailnet), opt in with:

```bash
npm run collab -- path/to/decks --host 127.0.0.1 --access you@example.com
```

and front it with `tailscale serve` (e.g. `tailscale serve --bg --https=443
http://127.0.0.1:5800`). Identity comes from the `Tailscale-User-Login` /
`Tailscale-User-Name` headers serve injects, trusted **only** on loopback
sockets — so bind `127.0.0.1`; any other interface refuses all requests. A
bare loopback request without any proxy headers (a shell on the machine
itself) counts as the admin; a proxied request that carries `X-Forwarded-For`
but no login — a tagged node, or the public internet via `tailscale funnel` —
is refused rather than promoted. Do not expose an `--access` server through
Funnel: nobody arriving that way has an identity. There are no passwords
anywhere: tailnet membership is the authentication.

With the flag on:

- Each deck folder gets an `access.json` sidecar:
  `{ "owner": <login>, "visibility": "public" | "private", "publicRole":
  "edit" | "view", "sharedWith": [{ "login": …, "role": "edit" | "view" }] }`.
  It is not part of `deck.json`, so it can never be edited through a deck
  transaction. A deck without the sidecar is public and admin-owned, so
  enabling the flag on an existing decks directory changes nothing until
  someone restricts a deck. Sidecars written before roles existed hold bare
  logins in `sharedWith`; those read as `edit`, which is what sharing meant
  then, and `publicRole` defaults to `edit` for the same reason.
- New and imported decks start **private** to their creator.
- The deck list is filtered per user and grouped in the picker (yours /
  shared with you / public); every deck-scoped route — application requests, assets,
  WebSocket join — enforces the same check, and revoking access closes that
  person's live sockets immediately.
- **Edit or view-only.** Every grant carries a role, and grants add up: a
  person's role is the most permissive of their own share and what the deck's
  public setting gives everyone, so a public read-only deck can still have
  named editors, and listing someone as a viewer never removes access they
  already had. A view-only participant gets the presentation page instead of
  the editor (the server redirects `/?deck=…`), reads every route, and is
  refused every write: non-GET deck-scoped requests answer 403, and
  transactions or theme changes arriving on its socket are answered with a
  resync instead of being applied. Losing edit rights mid-session closes that
  socket the same way losing access does.
- **Folders are invisible until something inside them is yours.** A folder is
  listed only if it holds at least one deck you can open, at any depth — so
  somebody who has been shared nothing inside a folder never learns it is
  there. The exceptions are the admin, and whoever created the folder (who
  still has to put the first deck in it). Creating a folder writes a
  `folder.json` sidecar naming the creator; a folder without one belongs to
  the admin.
- `GET/PUT /api/access?deck=<id>` reads and (owner or admin only) changes a
  deck's permissions; the client's Share… dialog — in the toolbar and on
  picker rows you manage — is the UI for it, with a role next to every person
  and a separate role for "everyone else" when the deck is public. Ownership
  transfer is admin-only.
- The server remembers everyone it has identified in `users.json` at the
  decks root and serves the list at `GET /api/users`; the Share… dialog uses
  it to autocomplete people by tailnet login or display name. Being listed
  grants nothing by itself.
- The `--access` argument names the admin's tailnet login: the admin sees and
  manages every deck.
- Display names come from the tailnet identity; `?name=` and the name prompt
  are ignored.
- A remote agent bridge is admitted with the same tailnet identity as the
  browser participant that requested its connection command. It receives only
  that person's effective access to the deck.

Without the flag, behavior is byte-for-byte the pre-access server — the
desktop app's Collaborate/Agent flows never pass it.

### Filesystem agents (`slide-agent connect`)

The standalone server uses the same *bring your own filesystem agent* model as
desktop. The toolbar's **Agent…** button shows a command that downloads the
server's bridge (`/deckwerk-connect.mjs`, built by `vite.bridge.config.ts` into
`dist/collab`, source `src/cli/agentConnect.ts` + `connectMain.ts`) and runs it
with Node 22+ against `'<origin>/?deck=<id>&agent=<participant>'`. Nothing is
installed. That bridge:

- mirrors the deck folder into `~/.deckwerk/mirrors/<host>/<deck>` (or
  `--dir`): everything the server lists under `GET /api/agent-mirror/files`
  (assets, fonts, …) plus `deck.json`, the theme and `notes.md` from the live
  session, an `AGENTS.md` brief rewritten for the mirror, a `CLAUDE.md` that
  imports it, and a generated `./deck` command (`src/cli/deckHelper.mjs`) that
  takes `slide-agent`'s verbs and answers them over the bridge's private HTTP transport
  (`/api/agent-mirror/export.html`, `new.html`, `validate`, plus the existing
  comments, context, render and upload routes);
- joins the room as a WebSocket peer whose hello carries
  `agentFor: <participant>`; the browser's own hello carries `participant`, so
  the bridge reads that person's selection from presence and publishes it both
  in the `slide-agent` context sidecar and in `.deckwerk-selection.json` for
  `./deck` (`inspect --selected` works either way);
- stands in for the desktop editor behind the file-based CLI bridge: inbox
  transactions are validated strictly, sent as this peer's `txn`, and answered
  once the server echoes them; `edit/*.html` saves go to
  `POST /api/agent-mirror/sync-html`, where the server compiles them and
  applies `htmlSyncOperations` (replace, add, delete, reorder — the desktop
  watcher's semantics, no 422 gate) as a transaction attributed to the bridge
  peer, registers the draft for the scratchpad, and returns `changes` and the
  ids the bridge stamps back into the file; `./deck apply` routes through the
  same watcher via a request file so a save and an explicit apply never
  compile twice; `theme.css`, `notes.md` and new files in `assets/` travel up
  (`PUT /api/agent-mirror/file`);
- reports what it does with `agentEvent` frames, which the server's
  `LocalAgentRegistry` (`src/server/localAgents.ts`) turns into the panel's
  activity log and scratchpad;
- stays running as the filesystem bridge while the person points their existing
  agent at the mirror. `--agent <cmd>` is an explicit convenience opt-in; the
  bridge never discovers or launches an agent by default.

`slide-agent connect` from a checkout runs the same bridge. The generated
mirror contains the deck's `AGENTS.md` and a local command shim, so the agent
uses the same documented verbs as it does beside a desktop deck. The HTTP and
WebSocket routes beneath the bridge are transport internals, not a second
public authoring API.

`--no-local-agents` disables agent connections. With `--access` the bridge
must be admitted under the same tailnet login as the browser that announced
the participant id.

## In the client

- **Open / New** — the toolbar lists every deck on the server, creates new
  ones (server-side `createDeck`, so theme.css and the agent brief stub come
  along).
- **Import…** — one menu in the deck picker, with an entry per format.
  Keynote (`.key`) and PowerPoint (`.pptx`) upload the file and run the same
  importer sidecar as the desktop app.

  A DeckWerk deck can come either way round, because a deck on disk is a
  *folder* and a file chooser cannot pick one — Open just descends into it.
  **DeckWerk deck folder…** therefore opens a directory chooser; the browser
  hands back the folder's files, which the client zips (`src/shared/zip.ts`,
  the same format the server streams out) into exactly the archive the route
  takes. It checks for `deck.json` before uploading anything, so picking the
  folder *above* the deck says so instead of sending a megabyte to be
  rejected. **DeckWerk deck archive (.zip)…** takes what **Save As… → Deck
  archive** produced — the deck folder's contents, or a single folder wrapping
  them, as Finder's "Compress" and Explorer's "Send to → Compressed folder"
  produce. Either way the deck is named after the folder and opens when the
  import finishes.

  An uploaded archive's `access.json` is discarded rather than honoured; the
  importer becomes the owner.
- **Share…** — on an `--access` server, who may open one presentation. Two
  sections, the shape Google Docs settled on: **People with access** lists the
  owner and every named grant with a role each, and **General access** is the
  one rule for everyone else — *Restricted* or *Everyone on this server* — with
  the role that hands them beside it. A sentence underneath says what the two
  add up to ("Anyone on this server can open it. Only the people listed above
  can change it."), because the sentence is what people actually read. **Copy
  link** is there too. Grants add up rather than override, so a deck can be
  readable by everyone and editable by a few.

  Uploading a talk you have already given is therefore: import it, then set
  General access to *Everyone on this server · Can view*. Imports deliberately
  have no publishing shortcut of their own — one deck, one place that answers
  who can open it.

- **Preparing video** — the server keeps a streaming rendition of any clip too
  big to send as-is (`docs/media-loading.md`, "Renditions"), built when a deck
  is opened and cached outside the deck folder. `npm run prepare:media --
  <deck-or-decks-root>` does a whole deck up front instead of letting the
  first presentation pay for it.
- **Save As… → Deck archive (.zip)…** — everyone, at any point, can save
  the whole deck folder (`deck.json`, `theme.css`, `assets/`). The server
  flushes the live session first, so the archive is exactly what everyone
  currently sees; unzip it and open the folder in the desktop app.
- **Save As… → Lossy export → Web…** — the self-contained web bundle, built
  by the server with the same exporter the desktop app runs and downloaded as
  a zip that unpacks into a deck-named folder: `index.html`, `player.js`,
  `player.css`, `theme.css` and only the assets the deck references. Open the
  folder's `index.html` in any browser, with or without DeckWerk installed.
  The live session is flushed first, so the bundle is what everyone currently
  sees. The server's own build (`npm run build:collab`, run by `npm run
  collab` before it starts) builds the export player too; a server started
  some other way without it (`npm run build:export`) says so instead of
  downloading a broken archive.
- **Save As… → Lossy export → PDF…** — opens a print tab (`print.html?deck=…&mode=…`) that
  builds the same `.pdf-page` document the desktop exporter renders — one page
  per slide, or per build stage when "Include each stage of builds" is ticked —
  at the deck's native pixel canvas, then opens the browser's print dialog:
  choose "Save as PDF". The headless server is plain Node with no Chromium, so
  there is no server-side equivalent of the desktop app's `printToPDF`; the
  page layout is shared with it (`src/renderer/print/pages.ts`) so both
  produce the same document. The deck comes from `/api/deck`, so the export is
  the live session. Because the readiness wait needs painted frames and
  browsers suspend those in a background tab, the tab asks to be brought
  forward, and offers the pages anyway after 20s rather than hanging.
- **Present** — mounts the real Player fullscreen over the editor tab, fed by
  the same WebSocket session: edits made while presenting land on the
  presentation live, exactly like the desktop projector window. Arrow
  keys/space/click advance, double-click exits. Selecting two or more slides
  in the rail first presents just that range, ending the show after the last
  one — the same `rangeForSlideSelection` rule as the desktop app.
- **Present → Present in Speaker View** — opens the audience in a second
  browser window and turns this tab into Speaker View: current and next slide,
  build position, presentation and slide timers, wall clock, and
  previous/blank/next/end. Move the audience window to the projector and press
  `F` there for fullscreen. The two surfaces are the same page in different
  roles, and they talk over a `BroadcastChannel` scoped to the deck rather than
  through the server — presenter commands stay private to the presenter and
  keep working across a network hiccup. **Switch views** trades the roles of
  the two windows in place, for when the wrong one ended up on the projector; a
  browser cannot move a window between displays, so swapping roles is the
  equivalent of the desktop's "Switch displays". Closing or ending either
  surface ends the show on both. Speaker View needs pop-ups allowed for the
  site; if the second window is refused, Present falls back to presenting in
  this tab and says why.
- **Present from a phone** — **Pair phone** in Speaker View's footer (or
  `P` on either presentation surface, or **Present → Present with phone
  remote**, which opens the presentation with the code already up) shows a
  QR code. Scanning it opens `remote.html` on the phone: Next / Previous
  buttons and left/right swipes, the current slide and whatever the next press
  will show (the next build, then the next slide), slide and build position,
  speaker notes with A− / A+, elapsed and per-slide timers, the wall clock and
  Blank. It holds a screen wake lock where the browser allows one (HTTPS,
  e.g. `tailscale serve`). The QR is built on the address the presenter's
  browser reached the server on — the Tailscale name — or, when that is
  loopback (the desktop app hosting a session), on the server's Tailscale or
  LAN address.

  The phone talks to the server, not to the presenter's browser: the
  presenting page opens a relay socket (`/remote-ws`,
  `src/server/phoneRemote.ts`), separate from the collaboration room so no
  collaborator ever sees a press. The page stays the authority — it publishes
  its state and runs the phone's commands exactly like its own buttons, so
  after **Switch views** the same phone keeps working. A phone may send next,
  previous, blank and go-to; never end the show or swap displays.

  Pairing codes are 128 random bits in the URL fragment (never sent in a
  request line, log or `Referer`). A code admits phones for ten minutes and is
  replaced while the panel stays up; joining hands each phone its own device
  key, which every command carries and which survives the phone's reconnects.
  **Disconnect phones** revokes every key and the code on screen; ending the
  presentation ends the session (a dropped presenter socket gets a minute's
  grace to reconnect with its session key). On an `--access` server both the
  presenter and the phone also need a tailnet login that can open the deck —
  a code is the presenter's say-so, not access. The desktop app pairs phones
  only while it hosts a collaboration session (presenting then runs through
  this same page); its standalone presentation windows have no relay.
- **Sidebar tabs** — Props, Theme (the full preset gallery + adoption
  controls, shared code with the desktop app), Build, History. Restoring a
  history snapshot broadcasts as an ordinary transaction.

## Local development

Run the vite dev client instead of the built bundle — it proxies `/ws`,
`/assets`, and `/api` to `localhost:5800`:

```bash
npm run collab -- path/to/decks        # terminal 1
npx vite --config vite.collab.config.ts --port 5651   # terminal 2 (or the
                                                      # "collab-client" launch entry)
```

Then open `http://localhost:5651/?name=A` and `…?name=B` in two tabs.
`window.store`, `window.canvas`, `window.rail`, and `window.bridge` are
exposed for console driving.

## How it syncs

- The server holds the authoritative deck, applies each incoming transaction
  in arrival order, stamps it with a monotonically increasing `seq`, and
  broadcasts it to every client (including the sender, which is how a client
  confirms its own pending edits).
- Clients are optimistic: local edits apply immediately, are diffed into
  element-level operations (`src/shared/deckDiff.ts`), and sent. Each client
  keeps a `shadow` deck (the server's decided state) plus its pending
  transactions; the visible deck is always `shadow + pending`, replayed
  through the deterministic lenient apply (`src/shared/collabApply.ts`). Same
  op stream, same order, same result — that is the convergence guarantee.
- Merging is element-level last-write-wins: concurrent edits to different
  elements or slides both survive; two edits to the same element resolve in
  server-arrival order; a delete beats a concurrent edit; inserts are
  idempotent. Slide-level properties (name, background, layout, timeline)
  travel separately from elements, so renaming a slide never stomps a
  concurrent element edit on it.
- An agent's saved page replaces the slides it holds, but not blindly: the
  export fingerprints every slide and object (`data-base`), so a save over a
  slide somebody changed since the export merges object by object — what the
  page left alone keeps their edit, what it changed takes the page's, their
  additions stay and their deletions win (`carrySlideState` in
  `src/shared/htmlSlides.ts`). The same holds for the desktop editor's
  watcher and an offline `slide-agent apply`.
- Undo is op-based and selective: Cmd+Z inverts *your* last edit against the
  *current* deck and broadcasts it as an ordinary transaction. It never
  reverts other people's work; if a peer deleted what you were about to
  restore, that part is skipped.
- Persistence mirrors the desktop autosave: debounced whole-file writes of
  `deck.json` by the server, which also watches the folder — an offline
  `slide-agent apply`, a git checkout, or a hand edit broadcasts a resync to
  every client.

## Media

Drag-and-drop works exactly like the desktop app: dropped files upload to the
server, land in `assets/` via the content-hash importer (H.264 transcode for
non-web-safe codecs included), and the new element is sized from a server-side
ffprobe. Videos stream with HTTP Range support, so playback and seeking work
in every tab. The inspector's non-destructive in/out trim sliders work
unchanged — they write `start`/`end` on the element and sync like any edit.

The desktop-only media features are the two destructive editors — "Edit w/
ffmpeg…" trim-and-crop and "Rasterize & paint…" — whose buttons are hidden in
the browser because nothing sets the inspector hooks that reveal them.

## Not in the browser client (v1)

The destructive "Edit w/ ffmpeg…" trim-and-crop and "Rasterize & paint…"
media editors. Like the desktop app, there is no
raw-CSS sidebar tab; theme.css is edited on disk (the server watcher
broadcasts it) or through theme adoption. The full list, with what each one
would take, is in [Desktop → web feature parity](desktop-web-parity.md).

## Known limits

- **One hosted session per desktop app, across all its windows.** The desktop
  app can have several presentations open at once, each in its own window, but
  collaboration hosting is not per window: it starts one authoritative server
  pinned to a single deck. A second window asking to share while another
  window's session is running is told to end that one first. What this implies:
  - You cannot host two presentations for co-editing at the same time from one
    app.
  - Ending the session, or closing the window that started it, hands the
    ability back; the deck's disk watcher resumes for that window only.
  - Nothing here constrains the standalone server (**Running a standalone
    server**, above), which is already multi-deck and multi-user: it keeps a
    room per deck and is reached through the browser client, not through any
    desktop session.
  - Making it per window would mean a server and port per open deck. That is a
    deliberate deferral, not an oversight.
- Do not open the same deck folder in the Electron app while the collab
  server is hosting it: both are debounced whole-file writers and will
  overwrite each other. Use the browser client, or an offline
  `slide-agent apply` (the watcher picks it up). The desktop app enforces the
  same rule among its own windows: opening a deck a window already has open
  brings that window forward rather than opening it twice.
- Timeline (build) edits are slide-granular: two people editing builds on the
  same slide at the same moment resolve last-write-wins.
- Two people typing in the same text box at once: both keep their text.
  Each live-sync push of a box carries the html it was edited from
  (`replaceElement.baseHtml`), and the server and every client merge it
  three ways with whatever landed in between (`src/shared/textMerge.ts`);
  an editor with unsent keystrokes merges incoming changes into its DOM the
  same way and carries the caret through them. Edits to the very same words
  resolve to the later one, and two people typing at exactly the same point
  keep every letter and every word whole, but whose space sits between the
  two runs is not decided. The presence badge shows who is editing what.
